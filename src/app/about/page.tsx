      <h2>Our Vision: Predictive & Preventive Care</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to shift healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive
        prevention. By integrating state-of-the-art AI models, we empower users

      <h3>Digital Twin Innovation</h3>
      <p>
        The **Digital Twin** feature uses ML to create a virtual, data-driven
        replica of your health state. It simulates "what-if" scenarios,
        providing compelling visual evidence of how lifestyle changes can
        drastically alter your long-term health trajectory. This is gamified,
        preventive medicine in action.
